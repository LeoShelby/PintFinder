# PintFinder

PintFinder is a project developed for the Human Computer Interaction course at Sapienza Univerisity of Rome.

The work follows all the paradigms defined for a proper development of an application:  
User profiles and Scenarios definition, Competitors analysis, Questionnaires, HTA & STN, Experiments...  
In this case the application would be a platform for finding and promoting pubs.
